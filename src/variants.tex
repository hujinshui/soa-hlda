\label{sec:variants}

There is several variants of the HLDA. We present them briefly.

First we will present a method which is a combination of the LDA and
the HDLA. In a second time, we present a method which allows to make our
computation faster.

\subsection{Smooth HLDA}
\label{sec:smooth-hlda}

If the HLDA works on a lot of classes, the estimation of the class
covariance becomes noisy. The LDA doesn't have this problem because
the within-class covariance matrix is the same for all the classes.

So, what is the solution when there is a lot of classes and the data
are not homoscedastics ? Burget\cite{burget.2004} presents a smooth LDA.
