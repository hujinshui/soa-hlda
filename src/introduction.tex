\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this state of the art, we present a dimension reduction method
which is a generalization of the Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA).
One main flaws of the LDA method is that it discriminates classes only
by their mean and do not take into account their variances. The
Heteroscedastic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA) method relaxes
this constraint to the price of a more complex solution (not
analytical anymore). Throughout the sections, the differences between
LDA and HLDA are emphasized.

This document is structured as follow: the first part quickly reviews
the LDA method, then the second part describes the HLDA method. In the
third part some benchmarks are presented. Finally the fourth part
presents some variants of the HLDA and concludes.
