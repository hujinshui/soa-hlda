\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this state of the art, we have presented the HLDA as a
generalization of the LDA when the data are not homoscedastics.
In theory we can get better results than with a LDA.
In our implementation, we have equivalent results to the LDA.

This method requires some powerful computer, but some methods exist to
optimize the algorithm.
